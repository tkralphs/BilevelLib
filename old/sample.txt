# sample data file, specifying the lower-level columns, rows, and
# objective coefficients (LC, LR, and LO, resp.).
# N - number of lower-level columns
# M - number of lower-level rows
# indices should be given 0..N and 0..M
# objective coefficients should not include upper-level variables (we assume)
# objective sense of the lower-level problem
